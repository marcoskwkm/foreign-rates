# About

This is a web application that simply displays mid-market conversion rates between two given currencies.

It is accessible at https://marcoskwkm.github.io/foreign-rates

## Example usage

I'm a lazy programmer so the desired exchange rates must be provided via query string.

Example: https://marcoskwkm.github.io/foreign-rates?from=usd&to=brl&from=jpy&to=brl
